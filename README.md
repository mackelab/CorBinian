# CorBinian: A toolbox for modelling and simulating high-dimensional binary data and count-data with correlations

CorBinian is a toolbox for statistical modelling of multivariate binary and count data with correlations. 

CorBinian supports multiple statistical models, including different variants of maximum entropy models (with fitting algorithms that scale to >100 dimensions), Dichotomized Gaussian models, as well as tools for estimating various statistical quantities of interest from these models. It has been developed and implemented with the goal of modelling spike-train recordings from neural populations, but many of the methods will be applicable more generally. 

This repository is based on --- and replaces --- the original toolbox [pop_spike](https://bitbucket.org/mackelab/pop_spike).


We tried to make conventions compatible across the different projects and to share utility functions, but there is still some mismatch in conventions and redundant functions.

See [github.com/mackelab](https://github.com/mackelab) or [mackelab.org/code](http://www.mackelab.org/code) for more repositories by the group.

## Documentation

### Maximum entropy modeling 

This repository contains efficient code for fitting maximum entropy models to multivariate binary data, including 
- second-order (a.k.a. Ising) models
- K-pairwise models (second order plus population-count terms)
- flat or K-synchronous models (only population-count terms, assuming homogeneous population)

Most of the code can be used with any other (binary) features computed from the data. 
Our implementations use MCMC and iterative scaling to scale to large (N > 100) populations. 

### Dichotomized Gaussian models

This repository contains also code for fitting dichotomized Gaussian models to multivariate binary data. 
Particularly fast code is available for 'homogeneous' models with shared mean- and interaction parameters across the population. 
A python implementation for the DG models is available here: https://github.com/mackelab/dg_python

### Secific heat analysis

This repository also provides functions for computing/estimating the variance of log probabilities and related specific heat capacity from multivariate binary distributions.  

## Usage

To get started, change base_dir.m to the name of the directory that the code is sitting in, run startup.m to set the path, and run one of the demo-files in the demo-folder. 

**We are in the process of integrating new functions for 'K-pairwise' and 'flat'/'K-synchronous' maximum entropy models into the codebase. Pleas note that until this is completed, there may be some compatibility issues.** 
A stable version of many of the spike-train analyses featured here can also be found at [bitbucket.org/mackelab/pop_spike/](https://bitbucket.org/mackelab/pop_spike/src)

Much of this code was developed in collaboration with---or even by--- the co-authors on the various manuscript. Feel free to use the code, but please acknowledge the source and paper appropriately if you are using it for a publication. 

If you notice a bug, want to request a feature, or have a question or feedback, please make use of the issue-tracking capabilities of the repository. We love to hear from people using our code-- please send an email to info@mackelab.org.
